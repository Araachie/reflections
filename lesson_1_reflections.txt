	I can see the exact line, that doesn't work.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	+ Commits are logical complete
	- Forgetting to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Git is code orientated system, which means, that files are more likely

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git diff allows to observe the changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that

	I can always go back to the previous versions, where there was no bag.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I'd like to sitemize my porject on oil recovery.
