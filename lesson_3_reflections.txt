When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

		When I work on a project with someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		I might want to stay with the version on my local computer. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are an analogy of clones on github machines. 
    I use clone when I want to have the same repository on my local machine.
    Branches are created as additions to the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The ability to work on the repository offline and real-time.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Manually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
